# Hashgraph API Portal

The Hashgraph API Portal is a reference implementation example for the [.NET Core Client Library for Hedera Hashgraph](https://github.com/bugbytesinc/Hashgraph).  It is written in [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) using the [Blazor framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor).  A running instance resides at [hashgraph.bugbytes.com](https://hashgraph.bugbytes.com).  This site is open to anyone who wishes to use it to interact with the Hedera Main and Test networks and adds no additional fees beyond what the hedera network itself charges for transactions and queries.

## Compiling and Running

This project is a [.NET Core 5.0 project](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) leveraging the [Blazor framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor).  Running a local copy is relatively easy.  First clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/bugbytesinc/Hashgraph-Portal.git 
```
Since styling for the site is written in [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), we first must compile the style source into [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html).  This is done using a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) project within the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment.  Change the working directory to the `Hashgraph-Portal/Hashgraph.Portal.CSS` directory and install the supporting node modules:
```
npm install
```
Next, compile the SCSS into css:
```
npm run build
```
The project is configured to automatically place the compiled CSS in the .net projectâ€™s wwwroot directory.  (For continuous development, one would use `npm start` which starts the webpack compiler with the `--watch` parameter.)

Next change to the `Hashgraph-Portal/Hashgraph.Portal` directory.  Issue the following command to compile and run the program in one step:
```bash
dotnet run --project Hashgraph.Portal.csproj 
```
Now the project should be available at https://localhost:5001.  (Note, your browser may have issues with the development certificate, please see the .net framework [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-windows-and-macos) for details on configuring developer certificates).


You can also load the solution file, `Hashgraph.Portal.sln` file with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
